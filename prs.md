Here’s the complete guide to push two Flutter projects (`rive_animation` and another one) step-by-step:

---

### **Step 1: Push the First Project (`rive_animation`)**

#### **1.1 Create a New Branch**
Switch to a new branch for the first project:
```bash
git checkout -b rive_animation
```

#### **1.2 Add the Flutter Project**
1. Create a folder for the `rive_animation` project:
   ```bash
   mkdir rive_animation
   cd rive_animation
   flutter create .
   ```
2. Make any required customizations to the project.

#### **1.3 Stage and Commit the Project**
Go back to the root of the repository:
```bash
cd ..
git add rive_animation
git commit -m "Added Rive Animation Flutter project"
```

#### **1.4 Push the Branch**
Push the branch to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin rive_animation
```

### **Step 2: Open a Pull Request for `rive_animation`**
1. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   https://github.com/HeyFlutter-Team/projects_hifza/pull/new/rive_animation
   ```
2. Create a pull request:
   - **Title**: `Add Rive Animation Flutter Project`
   - **Description**: Briefly describe the project (e.g., "A Flutter project showcasing animations using the Rive package").
   - Assign the pull request to the repository owner.

### **Step 3: Push the Second Project**

#### **3.1 Switch Back to the `master` Branch**
Wait for the owner to merge the `rive_animation` pull request. Once merged, pull the latest changes:
```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

#### **3.2 Create a New Branch**
Create a new branch for the second project:
```bash
git checkout -b second_project
```

#### **3.3 Add the Second Flutter Project**
1. Create a folder for the second project:
   ```bash
   mkdir second_project
   cd second_project
   flutter create .
   ```
2. Customize the project if necessary.

#### **3.4 Stage and Commit the Project**
Go back to the root of the repository:
```bash
cd ..
git add second_project
git commit -m "Added Second Flutter project"
```

#### **3.5 Push the Branch**
Push the branch to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin second_project
```

### **Step 4: Open a Pull Request for `second_project`**
1. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   https://github.com/HeyFlutter-Team/projects_hifza/pull/new/second_project
   ```
2. Create a pull request:
   - **Title**: `Add Second Flutter Project`
   - **Description**: Describe the project briefly.
   - Assign the pull request to the repository owner.

### **Final Structure in `master`**
After merging both pull requests, the `master` branch will contain:
```
projects_hifza/
├── rive_animation/
├── second_project/
```
